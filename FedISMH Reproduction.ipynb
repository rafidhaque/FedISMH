    "# What’s Done\n",
    "Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are split into public, private (client-specific), and test datasets.\n",
    "Both IID and Non-IID splits are supported.\n",
    "The splits are mutually exclusive, and the sizes are verified.\n",
    "Model Architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Four architectures (SimpleConvNet, ComplexConvNet, ResNet, DenseNet) have been implemented.\n",
    "Feature extraction from intermediate layers is integrated and tested.\n",
    "Models are ready for use in a federated learning setup.\n",
    "Client-Model Assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients can now be dynamically assigned different models (heterogeneous architectures).\n",
    "Compatibility with data dimensions is ensured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "Now that datasets and models are ready, you can move on to the core components of FedISMH:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Feature Vector Extraction\n",
    "Goal: Extract and flatten feature vectors for all clients using the public dataset.\n",
    "Why: These feature vectors represent each model’s \"view\" of the public dataset and are essential for clustering.\n",
    "Here’s what to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a script to pass the public dataset through each client’s model.\n",
    "Extract and flatten the features from the predefined intermediate layers.\n",
    "Store the feature vectors for use in the next step.\n",
    "Step 2: Similarity Matrix Construction\n",
    "Goal: Compute a cosine similarity matrix between all client feature vectors.\n",
    "Why: The similarity matrix quantifies how similar or different the models are in their representation of the public dataset.\n",
    "Here’s what to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the flattened feature vectors to compute pairwise cosine similarity.\n",
    "Optimize by calculating only the upper triangle of the similarity matrix (symmetric matrix).\n",
    "Step 3: Clustering with DBSCAN\n",
    "Goal: Group similar clients into clusters using DBSCAN.\n",
    "Why: Clustering identifies groups of similar models and isolates outliers (noise clients).\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "ε (epsilon) = 0.15: Maximum distance between points in a cluster.\n",
    "m_min = 1: Minimum number of points to form a cluster.\n",
    "Step 4: Noise Client Management\n",
    "Goal: Handle noise clients that don’t belong to any cluster.\n",
    "Why: Noise clients can degrade the performance of the framework if not managed properly.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Calculate internal similarity within noise clusters.\n",
    "Reclassify noise clusters as valid if their internal similarity exceeds θ_noise = 0.65.\n",
    "Align remaining noise clients with their most similar valid clusters.\n",
    "Step 5: Federated Simulation\n",
    "Goal: Integrate everything into a federated learning framework (e.g., Flower).\n",
    "Why: This allows you to simulate the full FedISMH methodology, including model training, clustering, and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Order of Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Vector Extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script to extract and store feature vectors for all clients.\n",
    "### Similarity Matrix Construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the similarity matrix for client feature vectors.\n",
    "### Clustering and Noise Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply DBSCAN clustering and handle noise clients.\n",
    "### Federated Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Flower to integrate the components into a federated learning simulation.\n",
